Cloud computing
----------------
Cloud computing is about on-demand delivery of computing resources/services to the world. The cloud computing offers #3 types of services
1. IaaS = Infrastructure as a Service
2. PaaS = Platform as a Service
3. SaaS = Software as a Service

1. IaaS
IaaS stands for "Infrastructure as a Service". All Computing/Infrastructure resources that are required for running/hosting the applications are provided aspart of IaaS like
	1. Compute Instances (Computers/Physical Machines)
	2. Network resources
		2.1 Gateways
		2.2 Firewalls
		2.3 Virtual Private Networks
		2.4 Subnets
		2.5 DNS Services
		2.6 Loadbalancers
	3. Hardware devices like storage
etc
The cloud vendors to offer flexibility in IaaS services they use virtualization technology.
	
Hardware Hypervisors:
1. Microsoft Hyper-v
2. Xen
3. VMWare Esxi

The cloud computing providers takes care of managing the lifecycle of compute resources like
1. provisioning    = creating a new resource
2. de-provisioning = destroying/deleting the resource
3. scale-out/scale-in = adding more resources (scale-out) / deleting existing resources (scale-in)
4. scale-up/scale-down = increasing the capacity of the resources (cpu/ram/storage) [scale-up] / decreasing the resources (scale-down)	
5. backup/restore  = automatic backup / restore incase of crash recovery
6. stop/start/restart 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PaaS
PaaS stands for Platform as a Service. 
3. SaaS
SaaS stands for Software as a Service
From the above we can understand every cloud vendor/platform offers all the above three services.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
There are lot of cloud providers are there in the market, what is the diffference between one cloud provider from another cloud provider?
The	difference between one cloud provider to a different cloud provider is interms of the service offerings they offer to the world.
	
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud provider
Amazon is not an technology company, and they dont own any software products (platform/enterprise). So at a core Amazon is very strong in offering IaaS services
	1. IaaS = built from scratch (machines, network, network devices, network security....)
	2. PaaS & SaaS = They collaborate with third-party companies inorder to offer PaaS and SaaS services. They have few service offerings interms of PaaS for ML, AI etc
	
2. Google Cloud Provider (GCP)	
Google is an technology company, but not into platform or enterprise software development. So google also offers only IaaS
  1. IaaS 
	
3. Oracle cloud Infrastructure (OCI)	
it is purely technology company that has lot of platform and enterprise software products of their own. So there are rich at offering PaaS and SaaS services
PaaS
1. Oracle Weblogic server
2. Oracle database
3. MySql Server
4. Java
5. Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC)
6. Oracle Soa suite
7. Oracle Service Bus

SaaS
1. Peoplesoft
2. EBusiness Suite
3. JDEdwards
4. Oracle Apps

4. Microsoft Azure
1. IaaS
2. PaaS
	1. MS-Sql Server
	2. Mail Exchange Server
	3. Teams
	4. Data bricks	
but they dont have rich SaaS
