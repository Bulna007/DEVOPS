How to install mysql server database on ubuntu machine?
Note: To install mysql server database on private subnet ec2 instance, temporarily we need to grant public network acess. upon installation we can remove

1. install mysql server database
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y mysql-server-8.0
	
2. alter mysql_native_password
sudo mysql -uroot
alter user 'root'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'root';

3. change the bind address
sudo vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.conf
search for bind-address property. By default the value is 127.0.0.1, which means only the localhost can only access mysql server
change it to 0.0.0.0 
bind-address=0.0.0.0
	
restart mysql server instance to listen to updated bind-address
sudo systemctl restart mysql
	
4. add a new user into the database and grant permission to access the database remotely
mysql -uroot -proot
create user 'paytmuser'@'%' identified by 'welcome1';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'paytmuser'@'%';
exit

upon completing the above installation, dis-associate the subnet from route table, so that it will become private subnet


Inorder to access mysql server database from public subnet ec2 instance we need mysql server client utility
1. ssh into public subnet ec2 instance
sudo apt install -y
sudo apt install -y mysql-client-8.0
	
Now from public subnet ec2 instance we can login into mysql server database of the private subnet using below command
mysql -hprivate_ip_mysqlec2 -upaytmuser -pwelcome1
